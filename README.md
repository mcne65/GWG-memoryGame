# Mona's Memory Game Project
This has been a long journey, but it is finally coming to an end. 
I learned , not only about development, time mangagement, learning styles.
But also about myself. 
Enjoy the game 

# How to Play the Game 
The game starts when you click the fist card. 
After you make 8 matches, you will get a surprise

# Issues 
1. The stars and the moves do not update on the modal 
2. The stars are horizontial instead of vertical, but I actually feel they make the game unique
3. My reset is not properly aligned 
4. I did not include any webkits, or media queries 
5. background CSS is off 
   
# Recognition 
Need to send a big huge shoutout to my co-hort, we may not be winning the co-hort challenge.

But in my book, we won something much more, a great support system and some great friendships. 

Carlos Finn, you patience is almost saintly, you came just a the right time. 

not only with helping me resolve the issue, but your affirmation that you gave me that I can complete this.
